# Altered-wind-forcing
A set of notebooks which help understand the effects of masking wind stresses in different regions of the globe. Using these notebooks, we aim to run a series of simulations with an ideal wind mask to answer the question - "The interplay between wind stress and buoyancy forcing in shaping the large-scale ocean circulation"
